              <p>
                In the next two years, I aim to master React for building
                intuitive user interfaces and Node.js with Express for scalable
                backend development. I envision myself leading projects,
                applying agile methodologies to deliver innovative solutions
                that exceed user expectations.
              </p>

              <p>
                I aspire to contribute actively to dynamic teams, leveraging my
                problem-solving skills and continuous learning to excel in
                creating comprehensive, high-quality software solutions.
                Exploring freelance opportunities and potential roles in tech
                companies, I seek to make a meaningful impact through
                technology, enriching users' lives globally with my passion for
